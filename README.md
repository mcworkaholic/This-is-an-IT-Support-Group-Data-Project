# This-is-an-IT-Support-Group-Data-Project
This project aimed to take salary response data from the annual *This is an IT Support Group* open salary report on Facebook and display it in a creative way using Tableau. The group is a private group on Facebook in which the *About* section says "For IT Professionals. We're here to support each other with both technical questions and IT career advice".

## Initial Issues
Problems arose after initial download of the data when it was found that the input given in the survey was not normalized, validated, or sanitized before being submitted by willing group members. In addition, not all question responses were recorded in each .json object, which is unfortunate for further data analysis. I made a copy of the exact form in case it gets taken down [here](https://forms.gle/rUWZVSgBwfQni6xNA) . As can be seen, many of the responses are short answer, which makes data analysis and segmentation a bit more difficult.
